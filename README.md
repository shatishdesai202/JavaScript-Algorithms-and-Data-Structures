<h3> ðŸ‘‰ To analyze the performance of an algorithms, We use Big O Notation </h3>
<h3> ðŸ‘‰ Big O Notation  can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm </h3>
<h3> ðŸ‘‰ Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear, quadratic, constant)</h3>
<h3> ðŸ‘‰ The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not hardware used to run the algorithm</h3>
